# Yuki Miura, Ph.D.  

I’m Yuki, a neuroscience and stem cell researcher stuyding the fundamental principles of human nervous system assembly and disease.

## 🧪 Research Interests  
- **Human Neurobiology**: Investigating the mechanisms of human brain development, connectivity, and function with a focus on disease-relevant neural circuit formation.  
- **Organoid Systems**: Engineering stem cell-based 3D models to reconstruct and interrogate region-specific human brain circuits in health and neuropsychiatric disorders.
- **Neuroimaging and Functional Assays**: Applying advanced imaging technologies including volumetric calcium imaging coupled with optogenetics, to study real-time activity and connectivity in human neural systems.

## 💻 Skills & Expertise  
- Human Stem Cell Models: Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into region-specific neural organoids and multi-region assembloids.
- Advanced Imaging: Live-cell and volumetric imaging of neural activity, including optogenetics and calcium imaging in 3D systems.
- Single-Cell Transcriptomics: Analysis and interpretation of single-cell RNAseq data to dissect cellular diversity in the human brain.
